# Lesson 1: What is Ruby

### Introductions

Let's take a few minutes to introduce ourselves, discuss programming experience, and set objectives for this course.

### What is Server Side Scripting?

Server side scripts are totally processed by the servers instead of clients. When clients request a page containing server side scripts then that server processes the scripts and returns an HTML page to the client. For example, an ASP page is not processed by the browser; instead it is interpreted by the server which can process ASP scripts and return an HTML page to the client.
